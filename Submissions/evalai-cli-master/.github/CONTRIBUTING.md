# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `evalai-cli`. It is thanks to amazing folk like you that this project is possible.

To make the process of contributing to `evalai-cli` much easier, we have some guidelines which we require every contributor to follow.

### Issues

Issues are a great way to contribute since they help us identify bugs as well as great new features our users might love.
We use Github's issue system for logging issues. Moreover, we like to add tags to issues to help identify priority, so if you see any tags that you would like to add to the issue, please go ahead.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the workhorses of any open source project. When submitting a Pull Request (PR), be sure to tag the corresponding issue so we know what the PR intends to fix. You should take a look at [this](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) to better understand how to point to issues.

PRs are always squashed and merged and should only be done so by maintainers so that both you, the contributor, and the maintainers are on the same page and can figure out the next steps. 

The maintainers will ensure the squashed commit's message points to the corresponding issue. This will help track code regression bugs.
